Hello! My name is Yixuan Huang(黄亦轩), and I am a 3rd-year undergraduate student at Wuhan University of Technology, majoring in Electronic Information Engineering. I am deeply interested in robotics and artificial intelligence, particularly in studying how robotic agents can perceive, reason, and interact with the world in a human-like and robust manner.

I am broadly interested in enabling robots to autonomously learn skills through interaction with the physical world and cooperation with humans. My research focuses on how to improve the robustness, reliability, and safety of robot behaviors in real-world environments. I believe this is fundamental for robotic agents to operate effectively in physical space, and it underpins essential applications such as household service robots and logistics manipulators. In addition, I am exploring navigation and decision-making in dynamic and uncertain environments, which is critical for enabling robots to move intelligently and interact within physical or human-centered spaces—applications include autonomous driving and mobile robotics. My long-term goal is to advance embodied intelligence and physical interaction understanding, enabling robots to generalize from limited supervision and adapt to new environments.

I am looking for research internship opportunities. If you are looking to recruit a research assistant or intern, please contact *'yixuanhm [AT] gmail [DOT] com'*. I look forward to potential collaboration with you!
